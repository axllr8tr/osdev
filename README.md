# thos

This is my OSDev project made from the ground up (read: made from mostly stolen code), just as a fun and stupid project.

Currently it provides a small shell with some basic commands (`echo`, `dec2hex`, `peekX`/`pokeX`/`memsetX`, `syscall`), but more are to be added.

Make with `make.sh`, QEMU should start afterwards. Please note that `i686-elf-gcc` and `qemu-system-i386` must be present on your system and in your `$PATH`.

Proceed at your own risk, may eat your cat.
